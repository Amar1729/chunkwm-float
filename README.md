# chunkwm float

Plugin to help with better floating window management in chunkwm.

Currently a work in progress, but i plan to support these features:
- move/resize floating windows
- auto-float the first N windows on a space
- query the dimensions of windows
- directly set dimensions of windows
- update --focus next/prev to optionally include floating windows
- updated query command to identify which windows on a space are floating
